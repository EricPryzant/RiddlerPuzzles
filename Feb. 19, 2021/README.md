In the game of Jenga, you build a tower and then remove its blocks, one at a time, until the tower collapses. But in Riddler Jenga, you start with one block and then place more blocks on top of it, one at a time.

All the blocks have the same alignment (e.g., east-west). Importantly, whenever you place a block, its center is picked randomly along the block directly beneath it. For example, the following animation shows Riddler Jenga towers that were randomly constructed before ultimately collapsing when the fifth, 10th and 15th blocks were placed. The block highlighted in red is the one above which the blocks were no longer balanced.

**On average, how many blocks must you place so that your tower collapses — that is, until at least one block falls off?**

(Note: This problem is not asking for the average height of the tower after any unbalanced blocks have fallen off. It is asking for the average number of blocks added in order to make the tower collapse in the first place.)

This week marks the third of four CrossProduct™ puzzles. This time, there are seven three-digit numbers — each belongs in a row of the table below, with one digit per cell. The products of the three digits of each number are shown in the rightmost column. Meanwhile, the products of the digits in the hundreds, tens and ones places, respectively, are shown in the bottom row.

| 0 | 1 | 2 | Product |
| - | - | - | ------- |
|   |   |   | 280 |
|   |   |   | 168 |
|   |   |   | 162 |
|   |   |   | 360 |
|   |   |   | 60 |
|   |   |   | 256 |
|   |   |   | 126 |
|183,708|245,760|117,600|  |

Can you find all seven three-digit numbers and complete the table?
